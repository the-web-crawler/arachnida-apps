    <h1>Privacy Policy for Color Dash</h1>
    <p class="last-updated">Effective Date: April 22, 2025</p>

    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>This Privacy Policy describes how Arachnida ("we," "us," or "our") handles information in
        connection with your use of the Color Dash mobile application (the "App"). Your privacy is important to us.</p>

    <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>We collect information in the following ways:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Information You Provide:</strong> We currently do not require you to provide any personal
                information directly (such as name, email, or account details) to use the core gameplay features of the
                App.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Information Collected Automatically (Third-Party Services - AdMob):</strong> The App uses Google
                AdMob, a third-party advertising service provided by Google, to display advertisements. To serve
                relevant ads, AdMob automatically collects certain information when you use the App. This information
                may include, but is not limited to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Device identifiers (such as the Advertising ID)</li>
                <li>IP address</li>
                <li>Device type, operating system information, and device settings</li>
                <li>Approximate geolocation data (typically derived from your IP address)</li>
                <li>App usage data</li>
                <li>Information about your interactions with advertisements shown in the App (e.g., ad views, clicks)
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. How We Use Information</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>To provide and maintain the App's functionality.</li>
        <li>To display third-party advertisements through Google AdMob, which helps support the App's development and
            allows us to offer it for free. AdMob uses the collected information to personalize or non-personalize ads
            shown to you, measure ad performance, limit ad frequency, and combat fraud and abuse.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Sharing of Information</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>We do not sell your personal information.</li>
        <li>We do not share personal information collected directly by us (currently none) with third parties, except as
            necessary to comply with the law, enforce our terms, or protect our rights or the safety of others.</li>
        <li>Information collected automatically by Google AdMob is processed by Google according to their own privacy
            policies. We do not have direct control over the data collected solely by AdMob for advertising purposes.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>This App uses Google AdMob. Google's use of advertising identifiers is subject to their policies.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>You can learn more about how Google collects and uses data when you use our partners' sites or apps here: <a
                href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites" target="_blank"
                rel="noopener noreferrer">https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites</a></li>
        <li>Google's general Privacy Policy can be found here: <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy"
                target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://policies.google.com/privacy</a></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Advertising Opt-Out</h2>
    <p>You can limit ad tracking or reset your device’s advertising identifier by adjusting your Android operating
        system
        settings. For up‑to‑date instructions, please see:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://support.google.com/android/answer/13720755" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Manage your ad
                privacy settings on Android - Google Help</a></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>7. Data Security</h2>
    <p>Because we do not collect personal information directly, we do not store user data on our servers. Google AdMob
        processes any data it collects under its own security and privacy policies. See Google’s Privacy Policy for
        details.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>The App is not directed to children under the age of 13 in the United States (as defined by the Children's Online
        Privacy Protection Act) or under the applicable minimum age in your jurisdiction. We do not knowingly collect
        personal information from children below these ages. If you believe we have inadvertently collected information
        from
        a child, please contact us immediately using the contact information below, and we will take steps to delete the
        information as soon as possible.</p>

    <h2>9. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will update the "Effective Date" at the top to reflect
        material changes and, where required by law, provide notice within the App or by email informing you of any
        significant revisions. Non-material changes may be posted without additional notice. We encourage you to review
        this Privacy Policy periodically.</p>
